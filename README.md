# Riceupdate

## *A script wrapper for Linux theming*

This is a program that uses fhadiel's `ricemood` along with a few other common scripts (`feh`, `sed`, etc.) to switch themes across a Linux system using theme presets or hex colors.

NOTE: This project is still heavily in development, and this will likely not work on any system but mine. This project has very big "it works on my machine" vibes. It was originally built for my current setup (i3 w/ Polybar and `picom-jonaburg`).

To install, either use the installer file (might need some permission changes), or compile the code, which adds this program to `/usr/bin`.

My config files are included as a point of reference, but might need some tweaking. This will be refined as the project matures.
