# Riceupdate

## *A script wrapper for Linux theming*

This is a program that uses fhadiel's `ricemood` along with a few other common scripts (`feh`, `sed`, etc.) to switch themes across a Linux system using theme presets or hex colors

NOTE: This project is still heavily in development, and this will likely not work on any system but mine. This project has very big "it works on my machine" vibes.

To install, either use the installer file (might need some permission changes), or compile the code, which adds this program to `/usr/bin`.
