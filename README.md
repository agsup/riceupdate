# Riceupdate
*A script wrapper for Linux theming*

This is a program that uses fhadiel's `ricemood` along with a few other common scripts (`feh`, `sed`, etc.) to switch themes across a Linux system using theme presets or hex colors

NOTE: This project is still heavily in development, and this will likely not work on any system but mine. This project has very big "it works on my machine" vibes.
